    The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to meet students’ needs. If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include: 
    <br>
    <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student confidence </li>
    <br>
    <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration   </li>
    <br>
    <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli   </li>
    <br>
    <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration  </li>
    <br>
    <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process  </li>
    <br>
    <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern </li>
