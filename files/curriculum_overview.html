       <h1> Curriculum Frameworks</h1>
       <p>

      Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is 
      presented in ways that are developmentally appropriate and based on
       our philosophy that children learn most effectively through play. 
       Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in:
      art, writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and literacy. 
      Teacher planning takes into account the social, emotional, intellectual, and 
      physical developmental needs of each child.

      </p>
